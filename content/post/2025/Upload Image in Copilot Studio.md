Your agent can enable users to upload images, which it can subsequently analyze to generate relevant responses.

Ensuring best practices for prompt engineering is crucial when enabling users to upload images and your agent to generate responses based on them.

**To get the most out of this feature, review the following tips:**
&spades; 	


1. Upload images that are clear and high-quality. Agents might struggle to interpret grainy, poorly lit, or pixelated images.

2. Only upload supported image file types, including JPG, PNG, WebP, or non-animated GIF files.

3. If an image triggers content moderation filtering, restart the conversation. The agent uses the current conversation history to generate answers and continues to return content moderation filtering errors if objectionable content is part of the conversation history.

4. Don't exceed a total of 15 MB for all uploaded images in a single conversation. Any images uploaded after the 15 MB limit can't be used to generate answers.
