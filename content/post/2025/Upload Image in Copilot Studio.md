In today's digital age, the ability to analyse images is becoming increasingly important. Microsoft Copilot Studio offers a powerful feature that allows users to upload images and receive insightful responses based on those images. This capability opens up a world of possibilities for enhancing user interactions and providing more accurate and relevant information.

I will be demonstrating Copilot Studio's Image analysis feature for an Insurance company. I will be providing car accident images as in input to the agent , this agent will help insurance companies quickly assess damage and detect fraud, speeding up claim processing and improving accuracy. This leads to faster resolutions and better customer satisfaction.ðŸš—ðŸ“¸
