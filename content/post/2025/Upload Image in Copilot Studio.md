Why Should we Allow Image Input?
There are two primary scenarios where image input can be incredibly useful:

Questions requiring information from configured knowledge sources: Sometimes, users need answers that are best derived from visual data.
Questions that can be answered from an image: For example, identifying objects, analyzing scenes, or extracting text from images.

Best Practices for Image Input
To get the most out of this feature, it's essential to follow some best practices:

Upload clear and high-quality images: Grainy or poorly lit images can be challenging for the agent to interpret.
Use supported image file types: JPG, PNG, WebP, and non-animated GIF files are supported.
Avoid exceeding the 15 MB limit: The agent can only process up to 15 MB of images in a single conversation.

Creating the Agent with Image Input
Enabling image input in your agent is straightforward:
