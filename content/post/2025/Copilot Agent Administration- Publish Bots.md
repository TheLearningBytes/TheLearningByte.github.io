Move data across regions for Copilots and generative AI features
Copilots and generative AI features that are generally available are turned on by default. 
However, you mightneed to allow data movement across regions to use all Copilot and generative AI features.

If you don't allow data movement across regions, that doesn't turn off all Copilots and generative AI features.
Copilots and generative AI features are allowed as capacity is made available in the region.

Certain generative AI features are powered by Microsoft 365 services and store data according to Microsoft 365 terms and data residency commitments.
